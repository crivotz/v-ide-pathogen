# V-ide
Vim custom configuration, oriented for web developers (rails, ruby, php, html, css, SCSS, javascript).  
I use this repository mainly to keep track of the changes that I made on my Vim configuration.  
But I hope that it will be useful to other  
  
Thanks to the developers of these plugins/color schemes  
  
N.B. I keep my configuration of Vim in my Dropbox so I can use on multiple computers (You can notice it in vimrc) and for a problem with symbolic links I had to rename the configuration file *_vimrc* instead of *.vimrc*
